        <p>I am currently a second-year student at the University of Illinois, Chicago. I grew up in Eagle, Wisconsin, which is a really small town of 2,000 people, and I had to drive 25 minutes to get to school; if that gives you a better idea of where I'm from. Anyways, now that I'm in a big city at a big school, I've been doing some big projects. Here are a few of them!</p>

                MY TEENAGE DAUGHTER IS USING GANG SLURS LIKE "LIT" & "HOMIE". I'M SCARED FOR HER. WHAT SHOULD I DO?

                For this first project, we created a flarf poem. For this, I found a Reddit thread and rewrote it into a poem-style text. This poem is about a mom who is concerned with her daughter using new terms, which she has never heard before.

              Project two's objective was to create a video background behind us, almost like changing the background in your Zoom meetings. For mine, I decided to paint in outer space!

              I am an Interdisciplinary Education of the Arts student, and I'm hoping to have my main focus be design. I've always been a creative person and wanting to create the newest and latest design for everything and anything. In this class we worked on creative coding on GitHub and Twine to make interactive websites. During these, I learned how to use HTML and CSS (CSS is still a work in progress, though...).
